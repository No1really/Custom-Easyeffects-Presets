# Custom-Easyeffects-Presets

My custom presets for Easyeffects, an equaliser for Pipewire. I bet you wouldn't have ever believed Linux could output sound this good!

- Use Bassman or Bassman Ultra if you are a fan of heavy bass.
- Use Verbaman if you love dreamy reverb

## Pre-Requisites
Make sure the audio server for your Linux distro is [Pipewire](https://pipewire.org/) by default. If it's not, you can install it by following [@mikeroyal](https://github.com/mikeroyal)'s guide: [PipeWire-Guide](https://github.com/mikeroyal/PipeWire-Guide).

You will also need to have Flatpak installed. If you don't have it already, you can follow the instructions at [https://flatpak.org/setup/](https://flatpak.org/setup/) to set it up.

## How to Use?

1. Install Easyeffects by [wwmm](https://github.com/wwmm) from Flathub using the following command:
   ```
   flatpak install flathub com.github.wwmm.easyeffects
   ```

2. After installing Easyeffects, open the application. From the top-left corner of the app, click on "Presets." In the dropdown menu, click on the "Import a Preset" button.

3. A file explorer should open up. Select the preset you wish to use and click on "Open." The preset should now be imported.

4. To enable the preset, click on the "Load" button next to the name of the preset.

# Optional

If you want the audio settings to stay equalized:

1. Click on the three vertical dots beside the maximize-minimize buttons.

2. Click on "Preferences."

3. Under the "General" menu, enable the following toggles:
   - "Launch service at system startup"
   - "Process all outputs"
   - "Process all inputs"

4. Disable the "Shutdown on window closing" toggle.

5. Keep the value of "Inactivity timeout" at 34 seconds and "Update Interval" at 50 ms.

Now you can play your media of choice and enjoy the custom presets!
